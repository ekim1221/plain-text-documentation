ALS is a non-curable disorder with the causes still largely unknown. ALS causes the death of neurons which results in the degeneration of muscle movement. As symptoms worsen, the patient gradually loses the ability to move and death often occurs due to respiratory failure. Genetic research is focusing on discovering abnormality in gene sequences. Although millions of dollars have been invested in finding a cure, there is still a lack of information about the disorder.
